# Abstract
Continue the last problem about chaos in the driven nonlinear pendulum, and constrct the phase-space plots in the different regimes.

On the basis of this, explore the intermittency route to chaos for r>=163 in more detail. Begin by calculating z as a function of time for different values of r. Try r=163 (which should be in the nonchaotic regime), and several larger values up to r=165 or so. For the larger values of r you should observe chaotic "hiccups" like those found in Figure 3.18. Next calculate the average time between these hiccups and study how it diverges as the transition to chaos is approached. While the idea here is easy to explain, writing a program to detect hiccups is a bit tricky. One way to accomplish this is to construct a histogram of times between adjacent maxima in z(t). In the oscillatory (nonchaotic) regime these times will all be the same. An odd value signals a hiccup.

In this research, I have made some changes. I shorten the content of backround section, and move parts of principles to each project in the content section, which I think can make results more clear and logical.
# Background
## The lorenz model and working method
The lorenz model was work of this kind by the atmospheric scientist E.N.Lorenz (1963) that provided a major contribution to the modern field of chaos.These are a complicted set of differential equations that describe the velocity, temperature, density, etc., as functions of position and time, and they are very difficult to solve analytically in cases of practical interest. Of course, this is just the type of problem where a computational approach can be useful, and that is precisely what Lorenz did. This prompted him to consider a greatly simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equations as applied to this particular problem. Indeed, he grossly oversimplified the problem as he reduced it to only three equations

These are now known as the Lorenz equations (or equivalently, the Lorenz model).

With this in mind, we plunge ahead and consider solutions to the Lorenz equations. They are just three, coupled, differential equations that are very similar to those we have already encountered in connection with the pendulum. However, the Euler-Cromer method is not directly applicable to the Lorenz model. However, it turns out that the Euler algorithm can actually be used to treat the Lorenz problem, for the following reason.

Several of the terms in the Lorenz equations play the same role as the damping term in the pendulum equations of motion, while other terms are analogous to the driving force. If the time step in the Euler algorithm is sufficiently small, the energy lost (or added) through the error terms associated with the Euler method can be made much smaller than the energy lost to the effective damping, or added by the effective driving force. In this situation the Euler method provides an accurate solution, as can be verified directly by simply repeating the Euler calculation with different time steps, or by comparing with the solution generated with the Runge-Kutta method. This exercise, which we will have employed in the computations described below. This is another example of a point we made earlier; the suitability of an algorithm depends upon the problem.

# Content
According to what we discussed above, we can give the following results.
## Value of r--chaotic behavior
Here, r plays a role analogous to the drie amplitude, F_D, inthe pendulum problem. The initial transient is roughly periodic, but it gives way to an irregular, that is, chaotic time dependence after t=20 or so. There are not many exact results available for the Lorenz model, but it is known that the transition from steady convection to chaotic behavior takes place at r=470/19. This is consistent with our numerical results, although we have not atempted to locate this trasition accurately here. 

With the pendulum we saw that the Poincare sections in the chaotic regime reveal the attractors in a particularly clear way, as with the strange attractor in Figure 3.9. Hence, we essentially used the driving force as a timekeeper, which told us when to make the measurement. In the Lorenz model there is no direct analog to this drive force with its sinusoidal time dependence, so we must take a slightly different approach. We already mentioned that the Lorenz variables x,y, and z can be viewed as specifying the trajectory of a particle moving in three dimensions. And, it is natural to consider two-dimensional slices through this trajectory.

When we make trajectory of the Lorenz model projected onto the x-z plane and y-z plane, with r=25, dt=0.0001,x=1,y=z=0,sigma=10 and b=8/3. We will obtain:

From the pictures, we can first know when r is about 25, there must be chaotic system. We see from the figure that even though the behavior is strongly chaotic, there is a very high degree of regularity in the phase-space trajectory. This attractor surface in phase space can be shown to be independent of the initial conditions. Codes are in [homework_10.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_10.py)
## The phase-pase plots
Hence, while the time-dependent behavior is unpredictable, we can predict with certainty that the system will be found somewhere on the attractor surface in phase space.

So we draw the following pictures. Left: z versus y, with points plotted only when x=0. Right: z versus x, with points plotted only when y=0. The points were recorded only after t=30, to allow for the decay of initial transients.

From the picture, we can see that the nonlinear system turns to a linear system and can be predicted. Codes are in [homework_10_1.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_10_1.py)

## The larger r
Let us consider what happens as r is increased. The motion is seen to be approximately periodic for many cycles of oscillation, but these periodic stretches are interrupted by chaotic interludes (hiccups?). The behavior is thus chaotic, but in a sense it is only barely chaotic. We make variation of the Lorenz variable z as a function of time, for high values of r. Calculated using the Euler method with a time step of 0.0001. We can obtain the following picture:

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_10_2.png)

The results here show that the system is periodic at r=163, and that it starts to develop some irregular features at r=165. The treshold value of r at which this transition to chaos is observed is very sensitive to the accuracy of the approximation. So, a more accurate calculation can yield a slightly different threshold value of r. However, the general result is the same, with periodic behavior at small r, changing to chaotic behavior as r is increased.

# Conclusion
Even we have not calculate the average time between these hiccups and research the billiard problem, we can research the chaos with the Euler method by plotting the phase-space plots. Through the computer physics, we can research many chaos problem.
