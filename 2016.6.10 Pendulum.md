# Abstract
The simple pendulum should be more realistic. In this homework, we add some damping and a driving force to the simple pendulum. And, numerically investigate the linear, forced pendulum with the equation of motion by Euler-Cromer method. Show nemerically the existence of the resonance, and confirm the dependence of the resonant amplitude on the driving angular frequency ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D), and on the friction parameter q. And then, in the nonlinear pendulum, we use the Euler-Cromer method to investigate the relationship between the amplitude and period numerically and recieve interesting results.
# Background
Examples of oscillatory phenomena can be found in many areas of physics, including the motion of electrons in atoms, the behavior of currents and voltages in electronic circuits, and planetary orbits. Perhaps the simplest machanical system that exhibits such motion is a pendulum, consisting of a mass that is connected by a string to some sort of support so that it is able to swing freely in response to the force of gravity. In the idealized case, ignoring friction and assuming that the angle the string makes with the vertical is small, such a pendulum undergoes what is known as simple harmonic motion. The main features of this motion are common to many types of oscillating systems, making it a paradigm in elementary physics textbooks. However, elementary-level treatments usually do not consider the behavior of a real pendulum, that is, a pendulum that has some friction, that is driven by an external force, and that is allowed to swing to large angles. The motion of such a pendulum exhibits many features not found in the simple harmonic case. Perhaps the most important of these features is the possibility of chaotic behavior, which is the central topic of this homework.
We consider how we might make the simple pendulum in the previous section a bit more realistic. We add some damping and a driving force to the following simple pendulum

And we change:

into equations adding damping and a driving force:(*)

where amplitude represents F_D and angular frequency represents Omega_D and paramater that measures the strength of the damping represents q.
We now consider a similar numerical approach to this problem with the effect of spin, so we can obtain the equation of motion

When considering a nonlinear pendulum without friction and without a driving force, we can obtain the equation below:

# Content
## The linear, forced pendulum

>. First, we receive the curve of the linear, forced pendulum with friction of (*).

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_8.png)

In this situation, g=9.8, l=1.0, q=1.0, Omega_D=2.0, F_D=0.2 and we can see that the resonance exsits when time is about 7 or 8s.

>. Next, let's consider the dependence of the resonant amplitude on the driving angular frequency Omega_D. The following pictures pick different value of Omega_D.

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_8_r.png)

We can see that when ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5COmega%20%5E2-2q%5E2/4%7D)(![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7Bl%7D%7D)), the resonant amplitude is the largest.

The codes are in [homework_8.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_8.py)

>. Then, we talk about the effect of the friction parameter q. Also, we pick several value of q in the pictures below

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_8_q.png)

From the picture, we can see that when q increases, the resonant amplitude will increase too.
In conclusion, we can confirm the dependence of the resonant amplitude on the driving angular frequency ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D), and on the friction parameter q.

## The nonlinear pendulum
We choose different values of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%280%29) and try to find out the relationship between the amplitude and period numerically.

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_8_2.png)

What is interesting is that the amplitude will be constant as the time goes by.

# Conclusion
The linear, forced pendulum do have the existence of the resonance, and have dependence of the resonant amplitude on the driving angular frequency, and on the friction parameter q.
