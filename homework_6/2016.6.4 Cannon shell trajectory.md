# Abstract
The cannon shell trajectory is a model worth to be researched. Due to mass of the canon shell and great velocity of it , its motion is related to air resistance. And air resistance have great influence on it motion. Besides that, whether air density have influence on its motion is a question.Therefore, after we compute the curve of the cannon shell's motion, we can figure out the way to hit the target accurately.
# Background
## Projectile Motion
If we ignore air resistance, the equations of motion, which are again obtained from Newton's second law,can be written as

where x and y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the projectile.If we were to compute the specific equation of x and y, we would obtain a more complicated algebraic equation involving our variable at three time steps. So, we use a simpler method the Euler method to compute the curve of motion, which leads to

## Air resistence
If we add air resistence to the model, the equations will be:

## Air density on different altitude
Then the air density on altitude could be:

where ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a\approx6.5*10^{-3}K/m) fits measured data fairly well. Here ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a\T_{0}) is the sea level temperature (in K), and the exponent ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha\approx 2.5) for air.

Considering the air density, we replace ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B_{2}) in (*) with ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B_{2}\rho/\rho_{0}).

## With density correction
We compare the curve of motion without density correction and with density correction, then the chart on page 30 can be reproduced:

We can see that density make huge influence on results.Codes are on github
[homework_6](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_6/homework_6.py)
## the maximum range
We take different firing angles (40,45,50,55,60), and we get the curve below:

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_6/homework_6_1.jpg)

So we can easily know that when the firing angle is about 45, the range is max. Then after computing accurately, we know that firing angle is 43 and the maximum range is about 24550 m.

## Target system
When target is moving, we can't set an initial firing angle. So we need to design a system to monitor and fire shells as accurately as it can.
I have known that we can hit the target by changing the position of the cannon ,firing angles and even initial velocity.
Codes are in [homework_6_2](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_6/homework_6_2.py)
### 1.Certain cannon position and velocity
The only one we should scan is the firing angle. If we scan 0~90, the accuracy can't live up to our expectation. So we choose a method to compare the first and the last possible value of firing angles and then change the former or the latter value to the half of sum of two angles. And on this way, the accuracy can be increased.

If we need to increase accuracy, we just need to compute for more times.
