# Abstract
The cannon shell trajectory is a model worth to be researched. Due to mass of the canon shell and great velocity of it , its motion is related to air resistance. And air resistance have great influence on it motion. Besides that, whether air density have influence on its motion is a question.Therefore, after we compute the curve of the cannon shell's motion, we can figure out the way to hit the target accurately.
# Background
## Projectile Motion
If we ignore air resistance, the equations of motion, which are again obtained from Newton's second law,can be written as

where x and y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the projectile.If we were to compute the specific equation of x and y, we would obtain a more complicated algebraic equation involving our variable at three time steps. So, we use a simpler method the Euler method to compute the curve of motion, which leads to

## Air resistence
If we add air resistence to the model, the equations will be:

## Air density on different altitude
Then the air density on altitude could be:

where ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a\approx6.5*10^{-3}K/m) fits measured data fairly well. Here ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a\T_{0}) is the sea level temperature (in K), and the exponent ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha\approx 2.5) for air.
