# Abstract
In constructing the Poincare section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phase with the drive force; that is, at times ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%5Capprox%202%5Cpi%20/%5COmega%20_D), where n is an integer. At these values of t the driving force passed through zero. However, we could just as easily have chosen to make the plot at times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi%20/4) out-of-phase with this force, etc. Construct the Poincare sections for these cases and compare them with Figure 3.9.

Investigate how a strange attractor is altered by small changes in one of the pendulum parameters. Begin by calculating the strange attractor in Figure 3.9.Then change either the drive amplitude or drive frequency by a small amount and observe the changes in the attractor.

And, we try to investigate the bifurcation diagrams found for the pendulum with other values of the drive frequency and damping parameter, but failed.
# Background
We add all three ingredients which were previously only discussed separately.First, we do not assume the small-angle approximation, and thus do not expand ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?sin%5Ctheta) term. Second, we include friction of the form ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?-q%28d%5Ctheta/dt%29). Third, we add to our model a sinusoidal driving force ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_Dsin%28%5COmega%20_Dt%29). Putting all of these ingredients together, we have the equation of motion

We will call this model for a nonlinear, damped, driven pendulum, the physical pendulum.

We again write it as two first-order differential equations and obtain

![]（http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D%7Bdt%7D%3D%5Comega）

We use the euler cromer routine, but there are several differences of note. First, the equation for ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega%20_%7Bi&plus;1%7D) is more complicated since we have a different equation of motion. Second, we adjust the value of theta after each iteration so as to keep it always between -pi and pi. If theta becomes less than -pi, then its value is increased by 2pi; likewise, if it becomes greater than +pi, its value is decreased by 2pi. This procedure keeps -pi<=theta<=+pi.

To demonstrate certain accurate predictions concerning theta, we need to consider the trajectory in a different way. Instead of plotting theta as a function of t, let us plot the angular velocity omega as a function of theta. This is sometimes referred to as a phase-space plot. Since we have already constructed a program to calculate theta and omega, it is straightforward to modify it to make the desired plot.

Then we plot omega versus theta only at times that are in phase with the driving force. That is, we only display the point when ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_Dt%3D2n%5Cpi), where n is an integer. When constructing this plot numerically you must be careful to account for the fact that time increases in steps of size dt. Thus, the points in Figure 3.9 were actually plotted when ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft%20%7C%20t-2n%5Cpi/%5COmega%20_D%20%5Cright%20%7C%3Cdt/2). Similarly, we could also plot at times corresponding to a fixed phase difference relative to the drving force for analogous results. This is an example of what is known as a Poincare section and is a very useful way to plot and analyze the behavior of a dynamical system.

## The Poincare section with different times
We comare times that were in phase with the drive force with times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times pi/4 out-of-phase with this force.

When we plot points at times that were inphase with the drive force, we can receive the following results:

And when we change times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9_1.png)

When times pi/4 out-of-phase with this force,

We can see that results move along axis y, and gather much.

## A strange attractor by small changes
### F=1.2 and F=1.0 and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D) is constant
When F=1.2,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9.png)

When F=1.0,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9_3_F.png)

### ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D)=2/3, 0.7 and F is constant
When ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5COmega%20_D)=2/3,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9.png)

When ![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9.png)=0.7,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9_3_Omega_D.png)

So F and ![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_9_3_Omega_D.png) heavily influence the attractor.

# Conclusion
It is possible for a system to be both deterministic and unpredictable——in fact, this is what we mean by the term chaos; and the behavior in the chaotic regime is not completely random, but can be described by a strange attractor in phase pace.
