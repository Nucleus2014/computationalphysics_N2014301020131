# Abstract
It is the problem about electric potentials and fields, which can be explained mathematically by partial differential equation. By calculating the behavior of two capacitor plates' field, we can use the relaxation method to obtain the result. And we can compare Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel method the SOR method.
# Background
In regions of space that do not contain any electric charges, the electric potential obeys Laplace's equation

We can solve the problem by using the following equation:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V%28i%2Cj%2Ck%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5BV%28i&plus;1%2Cj%29&plus;V%28i-1%2Cj%29&plus;V%28i%2Cj&plus;1%29&plus;V%28i%2Cj-1%29%5D)

We have the schematic of two capacitor plates held at V=1(left plate) and V=-1 (right plate). The square boundary surrounding the plates is held at V=0.

Use the symmetry of the capacitor problem to wirte a program that obtains the result by calculating the potential in only one quadrant of the x-y plane. Write two programs to solve the capacitor problem of Figure 5.7, one using the Jacobi method and one using the SOR algorithm. For a fixed accuracy (as set by the convergence test) compare the number of iterations, N_iter, that each algorithm requires as a function of the number of grid elements, L. Show that for the Jacobi method N_iter~L^2, while with SOR N_iter~L.

## The distribution of V
First, we can obtain the distribution of V:

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_13/homework_13.png)

We can see that in that region the field is approximately uniform and is directed from high to low potential. The fringing fields at the edges of and outside the plates are also evident.

We need to define ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20V%20%3D%20%5Cmid%20V_n%28i%2Cj%29-V_%7Bn&plus;1%7D%28i%2Cj%29%5Cmid) as the total change in V during the update loop. And the suggested value here should be ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-5%7D%5Ctimes%20N).

Codes are in [homework_13.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_13/homework_13.py)

## The computing velocity of different methods
We have curves about the iteration of different methods,

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_13/homework_13_2.png)

We can easily see that the SOR method has the least iteration, so by using it program will run fastest.

## A fixed accuracy
We have seen in our previous jobs that this choice of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20V%20%28i%2Cj%29) is too conservative. So to speed up convergence we will change the potential by a larger amount calculated according to 

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_%7Bnew%7D%28i%2Cj%29%3D%5Calpha%20%5CDelta%20V%28i%2Cj%29&plus;V_old%28i%2Cj%29)

and we can obtain the best choice for alpha is 

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%5Capprox%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B1&plus;%5Cpi%20/L%7D)

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_13/homework_13_3.png)

The best choice for alpha in the chart is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%5Capprox%20%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B1&plus;%5Cpi%20/L%7D%20%5Capprox%201.810), which is satisfied with the theorical result.

# Conclusion
We have discussed the capacitor problem and using three methods to calculate it. Then we find the best choice for the fixed accuracy of the SOR method.
