# Abstract
It is the problem about electric potentials and fields, which can be explained mathematically by partial differential equation. By calculating the behavior of two capacitor plates' field, we can use the relaxation method to obtain the result. And we can compare Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel method the SOR method.
# Background
In regions of space that do not contain any electric charges, the electric potential obeys Laplace's equation
