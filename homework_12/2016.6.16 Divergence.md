# Abstract
In the last homework, we learn to use the Euler-Cromer method to calculate the motion of the planet around the star (at the orgin). This homework is discussing about the chaotic trumbling of hyperion, which is similar to the nonlinear pendulum. Our results for the divergence of the two trajectories ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20_1%28t%29) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20_2%28t%29) in the chaotic regime, shown on the right in Figure.4.19, are complicated by the way we dealt with the angle ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta). In Figure 4.19, we followed the practice employed in Chapter 3 and restricted ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta) to the range ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?-%5Cpi) to ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?&plus;%5Cpi), since angles outside this range are equivalent to angles within it. However, when during the course of a calculation the angle passes out of this range and is then "reset" (by adding or subtracting) jump. Repeat the calculation of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta) as in Figure 4.19, but do not restrict the value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta). This should remove the large (![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta%20%5Csim%20%7E%202%20%5Cpi)) jumps in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta) in Figure 4.19, but the smaller and more frequent dips will remain.
# Background
It turns out that all of the moons in the solar system except one exhibit such synchronism. The exception is Hyperion. 

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_12/Hyperion.jpg)

It is a simplified model of Hyperion in orbit around Saturn. Our "moon" consists of two particles, m1 and m2, connected by a massless rigid rod. The dotted lines are parallel to the x and y directions, and intersect the rod at the center of mass. Theta is the angle that the rod makes with x. Saturn is at the orgin.

Through calculation, we can have the equation of the motion of the saturn,

We assume that the initial position is (1,0), so the initial velocity is 

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_0%3D%5Csqrt%20%7B%5Cfrac%7BGM_S%281-e%29%7D%7Ba%281&plus;e%29%7D%7D)

And then we could discuss the problem below.

## Simple comparion
First, let's show the behavior when the orbit is circular, and we turn e from 0 to 0.95 and compare it to the former behavior.

We can see that when the orbit is circular, the behavior is regular and repeatable; however, the results obtained for an elliptical orbit are very different. The behavior seen in this case is very complicated and erratic, and certainly appears to be chaotic.

## Diverence in -pi to pi
We learned that one essential feature of a chaotic system is an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Thus we obtained two separate results and a plot of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20theta%20%5Cequiv%20%5Csqrt%7B%28%5Ctheta_1-%5Ctheta_2%29%5E2%7D) as a function of time is shown in Figure 4.19. Here we give results for both circular and elliptical. The initial velocity is 5 HU/Hyperion-year.

Hence, two trajectories stay near each other, and the motion is not chaotic in the first pic. In contrast, we see that the one for the elliptical orbit grow rapidly, approximately exponentially, with time until it reaches a value of order pi, and it can't get any larger than that. This extreme sensitivity to initial conditions is one of the hallmarks of chaotic behavior.

## Deep research of dips
We have restricted theta the the range -pi to pi and obtained the results. The we repeat the calculation of delta, but do not restrict the value of theta. See what we got.

We can see that the behavior for the circular orbit is the same as part II, but when it comes to the behavior in the elliptical orbit, the large data is removed and the smaller and more frequent dips remained. It is the "turning points" of the motion of Hyperion.

# Conclusion
When the orbit is circular, the behavior is regular and repeatable; however, the results obtained for an elliptical orbit are very different. The behavior seen in this case is very complicated and erratic, and certainly appears to be chaotic. And this motion is extremely sensitive to initial conditions is one of the hallmarks of chaotic behavior.
