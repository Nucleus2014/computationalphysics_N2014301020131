# Abstract
In the last homework, we learn to use the Euler-Cromer method to calculate the motion of the planet around the star (at the orgin). This homework is discussing about the chaotic trumbling of hyperion, which is similar to the nonlinear pendulum. Our results for the divergence of the two trajectories ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20_1%28t%29) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20_2%28t%29) in the chaotic regime, shown on the right in Figure.4.19, are complicated by the way we dealt with the angle ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta). In Figure 4.19, we followed the practice employed in Chapter 3 and restricted ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta) to the range ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?-%5Cpi) to ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?&plus;%5Cpi), since angles outside this range are equivalent to angles within it. However, when during the course of a calculation the angle passes out of this range and is then "reset" (by adding or subtracting) jump. Repeat the calculation of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta) as in Figure 4.19, but do not restrict the value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta). This should remove the large (![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta%20%5Csim%20%7E%202%20%5Cpi)) jumps in ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20%5Ctheta) in Figure 4.19, but the smaller and more frequent dips will remain.
# Background
It turns out that all of the moons in the solar system except one exhibit such synchronism. The exception is Hyperion.
