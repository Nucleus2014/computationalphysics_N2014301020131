# Abstract
The content of this homework is that let us combine 26 letters with groups of "#" and do some stuff. In the final form, this
homework becomes a simple welcome software. And the users could input their name and get the information of "hello,name" by
several "#". Also, you can decide whether to reverse your name. I made three formal version of the homework which I will
mention below.
# Background
## 作业L1 在屏幕上用字符拼出自己姓名的英文
## 作业L2 在屏幕上用字符拼出任意次序的姓名
## 作业L3在80*80点阵上用字符拼出你想画的东西，希望脑洞大开！（比如字符，火柴人，实现移动、旋转等等）
# Content
## first verison
It can solve the 1th question of the homework. First, I created every line of 26 letters and made them into 26 tuples. I drew
shapes of them on the paper and symbolled each line. I replaced 8 same lines of "A" of A7. The other situations are the same.
Then I typed like this:
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# <nbformat>3.0</nbformat>

# <codecell>
A1="      ###      "
A2="     #   #     "

```
Then, it is easy to type my first name by using "for...in..." and you can change it into every name you want.It will output the
1st line of the letter in the same line and then the 2nd,3rd,...The result will be the letters demonstrated in "#" in the same
"line".
```
for i in range(0,15):
    print L[i],U[i] 
```
When you operate the orders above, the result will be:
(Pictures will be uploaded soon.)
You can change "print " orders into:(You should pay attention to the tuple name which must be letters.)
```
    print C[i],A[i],I[i]
```
## Second Version
At that time, I thought why not let users input every name they want and maybe it can turn out to be a welcome system by 
outputting "hello," as well. So I continue to complete this homework into a simple welcome software. 
However, there are many problems which I have been settled with for a long time.
```
dict={0:A,1:B,2:C,3:D,4:E,5:F,6:G,7:H,8:I,9:J,10:K,11:L,12:M,13:N,14:O,15:P,16:Q,17:R,18:S,19:T,20:U,21:V,22:W,23:X,24:Y,25:Z}
alphabet=["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"]
new=[]
name=raw_input("please enter your first name:")
for q in range(0,15):
	print H[q],E[q],L[q],L[q],O[q]
nameu=name.upper()
l1=len(nameu)
for i in range(0,l1):
	single=nameu[i]
	for x in alphabet:
		if single==x:
			new.append(dict[alphabet.index(x)])
l2=len(new)
print " "
print " "
for z in range(0,15):
	for y in range(0,l2):
		print new[y][z],
	print " "
choice=input("Do you want to reverse your name?(Y/N)")
for q in range(0,15):
	print H[q],E[q],L[q],L[q],O[q]
if choice==Y:
	new.reverse()	
	print " "
	print " "
	for p in range(0,15):
		for r in range(0,l2):
			print new[r][p],
		print " "
elif choice==N:
	print " "
	print " "
	for z in range(0,15):
		for y in range(0,l2):
			print new[y][z],
		print " "
```
## Third Version
```
dict={0:A,1:B,2:C,3:D,4:E,5:F,6:G,7:H,8:I,9:J,10:K,11:L,12:M,13:N,14:O,15:P,16:Q,17:R,18:S,19:T,20:U,21:V,22:W,23:X,24:Y,25:Z}
alphabet=["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"]
new=[]
name=raw_input("please enter your first name:")
choice=input("Do you want to reverse your name?(Y/N)")
for q in range(0,15):
	print H[q],E[q],L[q],L[q],O[q]
nameu=name.upper()
l1=len(nameu)
for i in range(0,l1):
	single=nameu[i]
	for x in alphabet:
		if single==x:
			new.append(dict[alphabet.index(x)])
l2=len(new)
print " "
print " "
if choice==Y:
	new.reverse()	
	print " "
	print " "
	for p in range(0,15):
		for r in range(0,l2):
			print new[r][p],
		print " "
elif choice==N:
	for z in range(0,15):
		for y in range(0,l2):
			print new[y][z],
		print " "
```
The difference between the third version and the second version is that you will choose to reverse your first name or not at the beginning. So only one result will be output and the screen seem to be cleaner.
# Operation
You can download the file from my ipython notebook:
[First version:name.py](http://127.0.0.1:8888/8f6d9e12-27e3-496f-b487-272edb1e2a5b)
[Second version:font.py](http://127.0.0.1:8888/fd88efe6-159a-4b18-9da8-65812cf367d2)
[Third version:test.py](http://127.0.0.1:8888/2277b08e-94f9-48b7-9f1b-e4b6f7f16102)
I only test them in python 2.6,Linux. If you do not know how to operate them, please copy the following orders:(only under linux)
```
cd place(where you save the file)
python xxx.py(name of the file)
```
# Problems
1. If there are too much letters to be output, the result will not be correct.
# Appreciation
1.Thanks to Ron89 to upload a vim. I study the way to insert pictures from that file.I make a branch with it and the address is
:[Ron89/thesaurus_query.vim](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/thesaurus_query.vim/edit/master/README.md)
2.Thanks to [James Lee](https://github.com/jamesofey) to correct my mistakes and communicate with me on my problems.
