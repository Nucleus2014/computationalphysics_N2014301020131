# Abstract
Consider a hypothetical solar system consisting of a sun and one planet in which the mass of the sun is not much greater than the mass of the planet. Now you must allow for the motion of both the planet and the sun. Extend your planetary motion program to include this effect. You will have to deal with a set of equations such as those in (4.7) for both objects. Investigate the possible types of orbital motion found in such a system. Begin with a double star system in which the two objects are of equal mass. Then explore the behavior when the masses are unequal.

Then we consider unstable value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta) that is not precisely 2. A related question, which we did not address, is how unstable an orbit might be. That is, how long will it take for an unstable orbit to become obvious. The answer to this question depends on the nature of the orbit. If the initial velocity is chosen so as to make the orbit precisely circular, then the value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta) will make absolutely no difference. Of course, in practice it is impossible to construct an orbit that is exactly circular, so the instabilities when ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta%5Cneq%202) will always be apparent given enough time. Even so, orbits that start out as nearly circular will remain almost stable for a longer period than those that are highly elliptical. Investigate this by studying orbits with the same value of ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta) (say, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta)=2.05) and comparing the behavior with different values of the ellipticity of the orbit.

# Background
According to Newton's law of gravitation the magnitude of this force is given by

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_G%3D%5Cfrac%7BGM_SM_P%7D%7Br%5E2%7D)

We consider a two-body system in which the interaction force depends only on the separation r. The relative motion in this system can be studied as if it were a one-body system; i.e., as if one of the bodies is at rest, while the other orbits about it. The moving body in this equivalent system has a mass equal to the so-called reduced mass ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu%20%5Cequiv%20m1m2/%28m1&plus;m2%29) where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two original bodies. The position of the equivalent body is given by the relative displacement ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Coverrightarrow%7Br%7D%20%5Cequiv%20%5Coverrightarrow%7Br_2%7D%20-%20%5Coverrightarrow%7Br_1%7D) of the original two bodies. 

It is easy to get the equation of r:

And then we can start to research and discuss.

# Content
## A double star system
We first choose two stars with equal mass and change value of e.

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_11.png)

We can find that the value of e have a huge influence on results.When we change it a little, the results will be different obviously.

Then we try to change the masses of two stars and use the same values of e,

We can find the same principle that we mentioned before. Codes are in [homework_11.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_11.py)

## The gravitational force with ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta)
Suppose that the gravitational force is of the form

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_G%3D%5Cfrac%7BGM_SM_P%7D%7Br%5E%5Cbeta%7D)

If ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta%5Cneq%202), an *inverse-cube* law, a planet in this system would not even follow a stable orbit.

When ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta)=2.05, we can have the following pictures:

# Conclusion
We can see that e have great influence on figures of orbits. When the gravitational force is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_G%3D%5Cfrac%7BGM_SM_P%7D%7Br%5E%5Cbeta%7D)(![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbeta%5Cneq%202)), the star will have procession.
