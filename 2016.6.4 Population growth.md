# Abstract
Matplotlib is a very useful tool for making charts, tables and so on. I learned it on [http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html) and tried codes provided one by one. And, I have done another homework on page 17 in the textbook. It is a model about population growth.
# Background
第五次作业
继续用第一章的练习题熟悉python编程，并熟练撰写markdown文档

(1.6:Population growth problems often grive rise to rate equations that are first-order. For example, the equation 

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\frac{\dN}{dt}=aN-bN^2)

might describe how the number of individuals in a population,N,varies with time. Here the first term aN corresponds to the birth of new members, while the second term -bN^2 corresponds to deaths. The death term is proportional to N^2 to allow for the fact that food will become harder to find when the population N becomes large. Begin by solving the equation above with b=0 using the Euler method, and compare your numerical result with the exact solution. Then solve it with nonzero values b. Give an intuitive explanation of your results. Interesting values of a and b depend on the initial population N. For small N(0), a=10 and b=3 is a good choice, while for N(0)=1000 a good choice is a=10 and b=0.01.)
# Content
This problem is to illustrate how population grows. It contains two parts, birth and death. So we consider one of factors as const, and try to understand the other one's influence on population growth.
## 1. Certain the base population N(0)
We consnider N(0) as const, and value on b differently. When N(0)=1,b=0 or 3, we have the chart below:

The curve is sharp in the b=0 situation,while the curve is much slower in the b=3 situation. So we can see that if people die on a certain degree, the velocity of population growth will incredibly decrease and be slower.
Codes are in [homework_5.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_5.py)
## 2. Change in the base population N(0)
If we change the value of N(0) from 1 to 1000, and value b on 0.01, wich is mostly the same as the true situaion, the chart will be like:

We can see that before 9s, the curve seems not to increase or decrease. However, it increases instantly after 9s with a sharp slope. That is to say, if the base population is large, population growth will have a saltation after a certain period of 0 growth rate.

# Conclusion
If a >> b , population growth will be incredible. Only when a is little bigger that b, the rate of population growth will be a perfect slow curve.
