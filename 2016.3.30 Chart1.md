# Abstract
 Matplotlib is a very useful tool for making charts, tables and so on. I learned it on [http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html) and tried codes provided one by one. And, I have done one homework on page 15 in the textbook. It is a model about a free falling object.
# Background
第四次作业
完成第一章的练习题（自己任选一题）

  (1.1: The velocity of a freely falling object near Earth's surface is described by the equation ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\frac{\dv}{dt}),  (1.8) where v is the velocity and g=9.8 m/s^2 is the acceleration due to gravity. Write a program that employs the Euler method to compute the solution to (1.8); that is , calculate v as a fuction of t. For simplicity, assume that the initial velocity is zero-that is , the object starts from rest-and calculate the solution for times t = 0 to t = 10 s. Reeat the calculation for several different values of the time step, and compare the results with the exact solution to (1.8). It turns out that for this case the Euler method gives the exact result. Verify this with your numerical results and prove it analytically.)

# Content
This problem is to find the relationship between the velocity of a freely falling object and time. 
## 1.No resistence
It is easy to get the velocity equation of a ideal free falling object model:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\v=v_0-gt)
  
We assume initial velocity is 0. When using Euler method, we can get the following equation to draw the line chart:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\v(t+Delta)=v(t)-gdt)        (*)

Under this circumstance, we can have the following charts. The upper one is v-t line chart, the latter one is s-t line chart.

We can see that they are both smooth curve.
## 2.Resistence related to velocity
We assume that the expression of resistence is(a is constant):

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\f=av)

And the (*) can be replaced by the following equation:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\v(t+Delta)=v(t)+(g-\\frac{\av^2}{m})dt)

We assume that the mass is 10.

So under this circumstance, we can have the following charts. The upper one is v-t line chart, the latter one is s-t line chart.

### 2)When a=100:

![](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/4_2.jpg)
All codes are in [homework_4.py](https://github.com/Nucleus2014/computationalphysics_N2014301020131/blob/master/homework_4.py)
# Conclusion
By comparing two situations above, we can see that even resistence has huge influence on velocity, the object's position changes tiny. The change of the first situaion is more obvious than the second one. It refers that when a is smaller, influence on the object is more obvious.
